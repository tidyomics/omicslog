Description: Provides logging capabilities for SummarizedExperiment objects. 
    This package extends SummarizedExperiment to include tracking of operations
    such as filtering and column modifications. The log is displayed when the
    object is printed, helping users keep track of the data transformations
    applied during analysis. This is particularly useful for complex analysis
    workflows where multiple filtering and transformation steps are applied.
